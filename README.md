Attender Feedback System
Overview
The Attender Feedback System is a sophisticated software solution developed to streamline the feedback collection process for events organized by institutions such as universities. The system is designed to enhance feedback management, ensure high participation rates, and provide actionable insights through an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

Key Features
Nomination of Eligible Respondents: Administrators can nominate specific attendees to provide feedback, ensuring that responses are relevant and targeted.
Controlled Response Period: This feature allows administrators to set a specific time frame for feedback submission, ensuring that feedback is collected within a relevant period and optimizing its usefulness.
Customizable Questionnaires: The system supports the creation and specification of questions tailored to each eventâ€™s needs.
Anonymous Feedback: To encourage honest and candid responses, the system guarantees that all feedback remains anonymous.
Insightful Reporting: The system generates clear and visually appealing summaries of feedback using React Google Charts, making data interpretation straightforward and effective.
Technical Specifications
Languages Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
Database: Firebase
Project Management Tool: Jira
Feedback Form Generation
The system features a dynamic feedback form generator, allowing users to create forms based on specified questions. This ensures that each feedback form is customized to meet the specific requirements of an event.

Project Management
The development process was managed using Jira, with regular Scrum meetings held to track progress, manage tasks, and ensure timely delivery. This approach facilitated effective collaboration and organization throughout the project.

Why This Project Stands Out
The Attender Feedback System is distinguished by its comprehensive user-centric design and advanced technical features. Key contributions include the development of the response period control, implementation of feedback anonymity, and creation of insightful reporting with React Google Charts. The use of Jira for project management underscores a commitment to organized execution and successful project delivery.
